# Pinky

This theme was based on [Abstraction](http://github.com/whmii/Abstraction), which in turn was based on [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper), the base for developing [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) themes. 

## Personalization

You'll want to put in your own facebook, twitter and website URLs. On line 17 in index.hbs you'll see a comment about that. Just edit the next three lines and away you go! :)


## Features

These features were included in Abstration and therefore in Pinky:

- Gulp integration

- Node-Sass

- Autoprefixer

- Image minification

- JsHint with Stylish
